There is a lot of flexibility to deviate from this structure, so please just use this outline as a starting point and add sections as needed to best address your question of interest. For example, interweaving more visualizations and analyses could work well. \n",

    "If there is additional code or data you would like to include with your report, you can append the full code for your analysis in an appendix section at the end of the document, and then include only the most important pieces of code in the body of the report. For example, you can exclude details of data cleaning from the body of the report, but include anything of central to your analyses, and also any information about particular choices you made that might affect the results and why you made those choices (e.g., explain if data was excluded and why, etc.). Including extra code in a .py file and then importing it as a module is the best way to include extra code. You can also create a GitHub page and add a link to it in your report. \n",
