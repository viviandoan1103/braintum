    "## Introduction \n",
    "The National Brain Tumor Society reports that about 1 million Americans are living with a brain tumor with an estimated 90,000 more to receive a primary brain tumor diagnosis in the following year. There are more than 100 distinct types of primary brain tumors, each with its own spectrum of presentations, treatments, and outcomes. More than any other cancer, brain tumors can have lasting and life-altering physical, cognitive, and psychological impacts on a patientâ€™s life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study addresses three research questions that aim to understand characteristics of brain tumor diagnosis and treatment to help reveal (if any) patterns of brain tumor presentation, to support diagnosis and treatment. Our analysis aims to understand the frequency and distribution of brain tumors within the studied population. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does tumor size differ significantly between benign and malignant tumors?\n",
    "2. What is the relationship between treatment modalities (radiation, surgery, chemotherapy) and patient survival rates?\n",
    "3. Does the first symptom presented predict the stage of the tumor at its discovery?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset utilized in this analysis was retrieved from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miadul/brain-tumor-dataset. The data consists of simulated medical repositories comprising of 20,000 synthetic patient records. While the data is simulated, its breadth reflects a variety of medical scenarios, incorporating diverse patient demographics, tumor attributes, and clinical outcomes."

    "## Data wrangling: Refining, Grouping, and Shaping for Analysis\n",
    "To prepare the data for analysis, the following steps were performed: \n",
    "- Rounded numbers in \"Tumor_Size\" column, for ease of mathematical manipulation   \n",
    "- Create a smaller dataframe \"brain_tumor_dataset_3\" containing variables of interest \n",
    "- Convert MRI results to 0 and 1 (Negative and Positive) \n",
    "- Convert \"Stage\" to integer values (1, 2, 3, 4) \n",
    "- Convert \"Gender\" to 1 and 2 (Male and Female)\n",
    "- Convert the three treatment columns (Radiation_Treatment, Surgery_Performed, and Chemotherapy) to 0 and 1 (No/Yes)"
